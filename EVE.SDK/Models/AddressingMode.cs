        /// This mode allows for more flexible and dynamic memory access but requires two memory accesses.

        /// Indexed addressing mode.
        /// In this mode, the final address of the operand is determined by adding a constant value (index) to the contents of a register.
        /// This mode is useful for accessing elements in arrays or tables where the index can be used to offset from a base address.
        /// It provides a balance between flexibility and performance.
        /// 
        /// Example: LOAD R0, [R1 + 0x05] (Load value stored at memory address pointed to by R1 + 5 into R0)
